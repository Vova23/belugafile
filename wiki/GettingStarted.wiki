= Getting Started =

To develop with `BelugaFile`, you will first need to sign up for a stratus beta developer key.  You can do that here: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/stratus/

Once you have a key, modify the `src/StratusKey.as.remove` file and replace `your key here` with your stratus key.  Then take off the .remove on the filename.
